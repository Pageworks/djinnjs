### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️

[WWIBS](https://github.com/Pageworks/wwibs) v0.1.2 introduced a breaking change where `message()` and `reply()` functions no longer accept several optional paramaters, instead they require an object:

**Message**

```typescript
type settings = {
    recipient: string;
    type: string;
    data?: {
        [key: string]: any;
    };
    senderId?: string;
    maxAttempts?: number;
};
```

**Reply**

```typescript
type settings = {
    replyId: string;
    type: string;
    data?: {
        [key: string]: any;
    };
    senderId?: string;
    maxAttempts?: number;
};
```

## [0.0.24] - 2020-04-09

## [0.0.23] - 2020-03-29

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️

[WWIBS](https://github.com/Pageworks/wwibs) v0.0.9 introduced a breaking change where a new `senderId` string value can be provided allowing actors to reply/reply all. This value is provided after the `MessageData` object but before the `maxAttempts` number. Any `message()` that provided a `maxAttempts` value will need to be updated to appear as the following:

```javascript
message(
    "recipient",
    {
        type: "message",
    },
    null,
    Infinity
);
```

### Fixed

## [0.0.17] - 2020-02-04

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️

`fetch-js` and `fetch-css` files have been removed, switch to using the `fetch` file.

```javascript
import { fetchJS, fetchCSS } from "djinnjs/fetch";
```

DjinnJS no longer supports multisite configurations. Instead, create a new `package.json` for each site within a multisite project.

Files now use `.mjs` file extension. [Click here](https://v8.dev/features/modules#mjs) for information about using the `.mjs` extension. Update the runtime script `src` attribute to use the new `runtime.mjs` file. This change could require additional server configuration in order to server `.mjs` files with the `Content-Type: text/javascript` header.

The `broadcaster` object is no longer exported from `djinnjs/broadcaster` instead you must import the functions directly:

```javascript
import { hookup, disconnect, message } from "djinnjs/broadcaster";
```

### Added

-   switched to `.mjs` file extension [#49](https://github.com/Pageworks/djinnjs/issues/49)

    -   fetch will use a provided file extension

### Removed

-   `fetchCSS()` from the `fetch-css` file, use `fetchCSS` from `djiinjs/fetch` instead
-   `fetchJS()` from the `fetch-js` file, use `fetchJS` from `djiinjs/fetch` instead
