# Overview

DjinnJS is an ES Module framework designed to assist developers in building performance-focused websites and web applications. Check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Pageworks/djinnjs) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/djinnjs).

Out of the box, DjinnJS converts traditional websites into a Single Page Application (SPA) by implementing [Pjax Navigation](/pjax) alongside an offline first content strategy. DjinnJS messaging can also be used by [UI Frameworks](/guides/ui-frameworks) when building a traditional SPA.
