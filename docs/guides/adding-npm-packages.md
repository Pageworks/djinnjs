## Working With NPM Packages

Sometimes you'll need to work with NPM packages and 3rd party libraries. The easiest way to consume NPM packages is to use a tool like [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/). Snowpack unpacks packages as a single JavaScript file configures the package to be imported using ES Modules.

## 3rd Party Libraries

Not all JavaScript libraries are available via NPM and not all NPM packages can be exported as ES Modules.
